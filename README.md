Atmospheric Deposition of Nitrogen to Casco Bay

# Statement of Purpose
CBEP is committed to the ideal of open science.  Our State of the Bay data
archives ensure the science underlying the 2020 State of the Bay report is
documented and reproducible by others. The purpose of these archives is to
release raw data and data analysis code whenever possible to allow others to
review, critique, learn from, and build upon CBEP science.

# Archive Organization
All CBEP 2020 State of the Bay data analysis repositories are organized into two
to four four sub-folders.  (One or more folders may be absent, if they were not
needed). Each subfolder contains data, code and analysis results as follows:

- Original Data.  Original data, with a "READ ME.TXT" file that documents data
sources.  DATA IN THIS FOLDER IS AS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED OR ACCESSED.  

- Derived Data.  Data derived from the originaL RAW DATA.  Includes
documentation of data reorganization steps, either in the form of files (R
notebooks, Excel files, etc.) that embody data transformations, or via another
README.txt file.  

- Analysis.  Contains one or more R Notebooks proceeding through the data
analysis steps.  

- Graphics.  Contains R Notebooks stepping through development of related
graphics, and also raw copies of resulting graphics, usually in \*.png and
\*.pdf formats.  Because of downstream graphic design processes, graphics
included here may differ from how they appear in the State of the Bay.
