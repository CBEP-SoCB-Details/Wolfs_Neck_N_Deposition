# Introduction
Data on atmospheric deposition is available at several different temporal 
scales, including daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual summaries.  Data
is also available in both concentration and deposition-focused versions.

In this notebook, we aggregate concentration data "by hand" to compare to larger
annual summaries.

                      collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")

```

# Total Weekly N Deposition
Weekly data is in the form of concentrations -- in mg/l.  Total deposition is,
therefore, related to precipitation.  We  want weekly loads in terms of mass per
unit area per month.  The annual deposition data is provided in kg/Ha, so we
want our weekly data to conform to that.  We need to convert units as follows:

### Converting from mg/l to mg/l N
First we have to convert from measuring nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) in 
concentrations of mg/l to units of mg/l N. For that, we convert to moles and 
back to moles of N.  In general:

$$[NH_{4}] ~ \text{(mg/l)} \times 
            \frac{1}{\text{M.W. of NH}_4 \text{(g/mol)}} \times 
            \text{M.W. of N (g/mol)} \approx 
            \text{NH}_4 \text{-N} (mg/l)$$

### Scaling from mg/l to kg/m<sup>3</sup>
$$ 1~ mg/l \times
   \frac{1g}{1000 ~ mg} \times 
    \frac{1kg}{1000g}  \times
    \frac{1l}{1000 cm^3} \times
    (\frac{100 cm}{1m})^3 =
    kg/m^3  $$

The net effect is to multiply by 0.001:
$$ 10^{-3} \times 10^{-3} \times 10^{-3} \times 10^6 = 10 ^{-3} = 0.001$$

### Converting from kg/m<sup>3</sup> to kg/Ha
Annual and seasonal totals reported from the station are in kg/ha 
(as NO3, NH4, or N, depending on the nitrogen parameter).

Conversion is based on precipitation, which is recorded in cm in monthly
(seasonal) and annual data, and in mm for the weekly (and daily) data.  The net
effect is that the conversion factor for precipitation (P) in cm, time 100:

$$
kg/m^3 \times 
(P(cm) \times \frac{1m}{100cm}) \times 
10,000 m^2/Ha) = 
P \times 100
$$
And for data in mm, we use a factor of 10.

## Should we Use `ppt` or `subppt`?
It looks like the two are equal in this data set.  Metadata suggests `subppt`
replaces some missing values, so it may be slightly more complete. Note that 
`subppt` is only available from the weekly data, which won't show up here.

# Generate Weekly N Deposition Data
```{r calc_weekly_dep_data}
MW_NH4 <- 14.007 + (1.008 * 4)
MW_NO3 <- 14.007 +(15.999 * 3)
MW_N <- 14.007

weekly_dep_data <- weekly_data %>%
  select(yr, month, ppt, dateon, dateoff, svol, subppt, 
         valcode, invalcode, NH4, flagNH4, NO3, flagNO3) %>%
  
  # Convert to total N, in kg/m^3
  mutate(NH4_N = NH4*(MW_N / MW_NH4) * 10^-3,
         NO3_N = NO3*(MW_N / MW_NO3)* 10^-3,
         concN = NH4_N + NO3_N) %>%
  
  # Convert to kg/ha
  mutate(NH4_N_tot = NH4_N * ppt * 10,
         NO3_N_tot =   NO3_N * ppt * 10,
          totalN  = NH4_N_tot + NO3_N_tot,
         logtotalN = log(totalN),
         log1ptotalN = log1p(totalN)) %>%
  
  # Calculate a "censored value flag" for total N
  # The following indicates when EITHER constituent was censored.  What we know
  # is the sum is LESS THAN the sum of the censored and uncensored values, so 
  # this works
  mutate(flagconcN = if_else(((flagNH4 == '<' ) | (flagNO3 == '<')), '<',''),
         flagtotalN = flagconcN)
```

# Monthly N Deposition
The monthly data comes in the form of "precipitation weighted mean
concentrations."  We find nothing in the metadata that clearly describes methods,
so we're not 100% certain what this means.  Our interpretation is that this is a
weighted average, where each weekly observation is weighted by the weekly
precipitation to generate a monthly estimate. This should allow us to get a good
estimate of total deposition by multiplying by the total precipitation of the
month. Again, we am uncertain how missing values and low-quality data were
handled.

We want monthly loads in terms of mass per unit area per month.  The 
annual deposition data is provided in kg/Ha, so we can follow the same strategy 
we used for the weekly samples. (Note that the sum of weekly values may not 
identically match the monthly estimates, since not all weekly values are valid.)

## Monthly Data
```{r calc_monthly_dep_data}
monthly_dep_data <- monthly_data %>%
  select(-SO4) %>%
  mutate(NH4_N = NH4*(MW_N / MW_NH4) * 10^-3, 
         NO3_N = NO3*(MW_N / MW_NO3)* 10^-3,
         concN = NH4_N+NO3_N, 
         totalN  = (NO3_N + NH4_N)*ppt * 100,
         logtotalN = log(totalN),
         log1ptotalN = log1p(totalN))
```

# Analysis
## Comparison of Weekly, Monthly, and Annual Deposition Estimates
```{r compare_three}
ggplot(weekly_dep_data,aes(yr, totalN)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  stat_summary(color = 'green') +
  geom_point(data = monthly_dep_data, mapping = aes(yr, totalN), color = 'red') +
  geom_line(data = annual_data, mapping = aes(yr, totalN))
```

Weekly values are in black.  Annual means of the weekly data are green.  Monthly
reported values are red dots. 

Weekly data should be about a quarter of monthly data.  Monthly data should be 
about 1/12 of annual values.  It looks like we are pretty close.

```{r tmp_data}
tmp1 <- weekly_dep_data %>%
  group_by(month,yr) %>%
 summarize (mo_avg_weeks = sum(totalN),
            .groups = 'drop')

tmp2 <- monthly_dep_data %>%
  left_join(tmp1)
```

```{r plot_weekly}
ggplot(tmp2, aes(totalN, mo_avg_weeks)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0)
```

Monthly and weekly data are NEARLY identical when pooled to monthly totals.

```{r tmp_data_2}
tmp1 <- weekly_dep_data %>%
  group_by(yr) %>%
  summarize (ann_dep_weeks = sum(totalN, na.rm = TRUE),
             n_weeks = sum(! is.na(totalN)),
            .groups = 'drop')

tmp2 <- monthly_dep_data %>%
  group_by(yr) %>%
  summarize (ann_dep_months =  sum(totalN, na.rm = TRUE),
             n_months = sum(! is.na(totalN)),
            .groups = 'drop')

tmp3 <- annual_data %>%
  rename(annual_dep = totalN) %>%
  left_join(tmp1, by = "yr") %>%
  left_join(tmp2, by = "yr")
```

```{r plot_weekly_dep, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(tmp3, aes(annual_dep)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = ann_dep_weeks, size = n_weeks), color = 'red') +
  geom_text(aes(label = yr, y = ann_dep_weeks), 
            size = 2.5,
            nudge_x = 0.05, nudge_y = -0.025, hjust = 0) +
  scale_size(name = 'Weeks of Data') +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 9),
        legend.position = c(.25, .8)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +
  xlab('Annual Totals') +
  ylab('Sum of Weekly Totals') +
  xlim(0,6) +
  ylim(0,6) +
  coord_equal()
```
So here what we are seeing is sums of weekly values that are LOW -- presumably
because of missing values.  Dots are scaled by number of weekly samples
available, and there is an apparent relationship.  Sums of weekly totals 
are slightly higher for years with more weeks of usable data.

We can check if that is the only difference by calculating a version scaled by
weeks with usable data:

```{r plot_weekly_dep_rescaled, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}

tmp3 %>%
  mutate(est_dep_weeks =  ann_dep_weeks *(52/n_weeks)) %>%
ggplot(aes(annual_dep)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = est_dep_weeks), color = 'orange') +
  geom_text(aes(label = yr, y = est_dep_weeks), 
            size = 2.5,
            nudge_x = 0.05, nudge_y = -0.025, hjust = 0) +
  scale_size(name = 'Weeks of Data') +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 9),
        legend.position = c(.25, .8)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +
  xlab('Annual Totals') +
  ylab('Sum of Weekly Totals') +
  xlim(0,7) +
  ylim(0,7) +
  coord_equal()
```
That gets us close to that 1:1 line, but it over corrects compared to what the
data providers did.  It is possible that the annual sums provided are based on
adding up data that can be ruled valid (or not) on a shorter time interval.


```{r plot_monthly, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(tmp3, aes(annual_dep, )) +
  geom_point(aes(y = ann_dep_months, size = n_months), color = 'red') +
  geom_text(aes(label = yr, y = ann_dep_months), 
            size = 2.5,
            nudge_x = 0.05, nudge_y = -0.025, hjust = 0) +
  scale_size(breaks = c(11,12), name = 'Months of Data') +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 9),
        legend.position = c(.1, .9)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +
  xlab('Annual Totals') +
  ylab('Sum of Monthly Totals') +
  xlim(0,6) +
  ylim(0,6) +
  coord_equal()
```
Monthly totals are not equal to the annual values. There is a high correlation,
but they are not identical.  Presumably this reflects data the process of
weighting actual data, QA/QC, and related processes.

# Conclusion
We have confirmed that the weekly and monthly data represent what we thought 
they did, but also that we do not fully understand the process by which the data
are aggregated to annual (and monthly, seasonal) totals.

We could continue to explore this further by looking at the values of
`Criteria1`, `Criteria2`, and `Criteria3`, and try to reconstruct the way
aggregated values are assembled. 

  
|Name         | Value  | Meaning  
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|  
|Criteria1    |  75    | Percentage of the summary period for which there are valid samples.|  
|Criteria2    |  90    |   Percentage of the summary period for which precipitation amounts are available either from the rain gage or from the sample volume.|  
|Criteria3    |  75    | Percentage of the total measured precipitation associated with valid samples.|  

For State of Casco Bay purposes, we are going to be better off relying on the 
aggregation prepared by the data providers.  The only exception is going to be 
if we want to conduct detailed time series analyses, which are not necessary
for SoCB.

The only weakness of this approach is that we are unable to carry forward
estimates of precision or error for the aggregates we report.  However, 
for the annual data, 

# Follow up: What happened in 2012?
Data for 2012 shows estimated annual deposition higher by nearly a factor of 
two than other data.  It's worth doing a little digging to see what 
happened.

The first thing to notice is that while the estimated annual totals reported for 
2012 are somewhat higher than the weekly totals, they are not "out of line"
with the other annual estimates.  The annual totals are proportionally about
the same degree higher than other years...
```{r look_at_2012}
annual_data %>%
  filter(yr == 2012) %>%
  select(yr, contains('Criteria'))
```

SO note that 2012 meets all three of the data quality criteria.  it is NOT a
year we can ignore as invalid data.
```{r plot_recent_weekly}
weekly_data %>%
  filter(yr > 2010) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dateon)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = NH4), color = 'red') +
  geom_point(aes(y = NO3), color = 'orange') +
  ylab('Concentration (mg/l)') +
  xlab('')
```
We note no anomalously high nitrate values in 2012, but several high -- but not
outrageous -- NH4 concentrations that year.

That year saw significant changes in management at Wolfe's Neck Farm.  It is
possible that 2012 was the year that the Wolfe's Neck Farm manure management
system was decommissioned, which would have released significant ammonium
locally.  If that is the case, that year would not be reflective of regional
deposition.

We have placed a call to Wolfe Neck Farm to explore and hopefully confirm that 
possibility.
